<h1>Global Warming Natural Causes</h1>
<p>
While human activities are the primary drivers of global warming today, there are also natural causes that have contributed to changes in Earth's climate over time.<br> Here are some of the key natural causes of global warming:<br>

1. Volcanic Activity<br>
Volcanic eruptions release gases such as carbon dioxide (CO₂) and sulfur dioxide (SO₂) into the atmosphere.<br>
While sulfur dioxide can cause short-term cooling by reflecting sunlight away from Earth, the CO₂ emitted during large volcanic eruptions can contribute to warming by enhancing the greenhouse effect.<br>
2. Solar Radiation Variations<br>
Changes in the sun's energy output, known as solar irradiance, can cause variations in Earth's climate.<br>
During periods of increased solar activity, more solar energy reaches Earth, potentially contributing to warming.<br>
However, solar variations are not the primary cause of the current trend of global warming.<br>
3. Ocean Currents<br>
Changes in ocean circulation patterns can influence global temperatures.<br>
Ocean currents distribute heat across the planet, and disruptions in these currents can cause temporary changes in climate.<br>
For example, the El Niño and La Niña phenomena affect global weather patterns and temperatures.<br>
4. Earth’s Orbital Changes (Milankovitch Cycles)<br>
The Earth's orbit around the sun changes over thousands of years in cycles called Milankovitch cycles, which affect the planet's climate.<br>
These cycles include changes in:<br>
Eccentricity (shape of Earth's orbit)<br>
Axial tilt (angle of Earth's axis)<br>
Precession (wobble in Earth's rotation)<br>
These cycles influence the amount of sunlight Earth receives and have historically triggered periods of warming and cooling, such as the Ice Ages.<br>
5. Natural Release of Greenhouse Gases<br>
Natural sources of greenhouse gases include:<br>
Wetlands, which release methane.<br>
Permafrost melting, which can release stored carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere.<br>
Forest fires and decaying vegetation, which emit CO₂.<br>
6. Tectonic Activity<br>
The movement of tectonic plates can affect Earth's climate over millions of years by altering the configuration of the continents and ocean basins.<br>
This impacts ocean currents, atmospheric circulation, and volcanic activity, all of which can influence climate conditions.<br>
While these natural factors have played a role in Earth’s climate changes throughout history, the current trend of global warming is largely attributed to human-induced causes—especially the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which have dramatically accelerated the warming process.<br> Natural causes operate on much longer time scales and cannot explain the rapid temperature increases observed in recent decades.<br>
