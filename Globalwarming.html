Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to<br> human activities, particularly the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane<br>  (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O). These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to a phenomenon <br>known as the greenhouse effect.
<br>
Causes of Global Warming:<br>
Burning of Fossil Fuels – Activities like burning coal, oil, and natural gas for energy <br>production, transportation, and industry release large amounts of CO₂.<br>
Deforestation – Cutting down forests reduces the planet’s capacity to absorb CO₂, further <br>increasing its concentration in the atmosphere.<br>
Industrial Activities – Factories and production processes contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
Agriculture – Livestock farming produces methane, while certain fertilizers release nitrous oxide,<br> both potent greenhouse gases.<br>
Consequences of Global Warming:<br>
Melting Polar Ice Caps and Glaciers – Leads to rising sea levels, which can cause coastal flooding.<br>
Extreme Weather Events – Increased frequency and intensity of events such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves.<br>
Disruption of Ecosystems – Many species are at risk of extinction as their habitats change or disappear due to warmer temperatures.<br>
Impact on Agriculture – Altered growing seasons and more unpredictable weather patterns affect food production and water supplies.<br>
Solutions:<br>
To mitigate global warming, efforts must focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through:<br>
Transition to Renewable Energy – Utilizing wind, solar, and other renewable sources instead of <br> fossil fuels.<br>
Reforestation – Planting more trees to absorb CO₂ from the atmosphere.<br>
Energy Efficiency – Reducing energy consumption in homes, industries, and transportation.<br>
Sustainable Agriculture – Adopting practices that reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions.<br>
Addressing global warming requires global cooperation and long-term commitment to ensure the <br>sustainability of our planet for future generations.<br>
